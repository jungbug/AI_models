# Custom CNN for Image Classification

This repository provides an example of building a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow for image classification tasks.

## Required Library Installation

You need to install the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras

The easiest way to install these libraries is by using the `pip` command, for example:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Data Preparation
Since this code deals with image data, you should download the dataset in advance and set the directory path in the dir_ variable.

Model Description
The model used in this example consists of the following layers:

Input Layer
Image Preprocessing Layer
Data Augmentation Layer
Convolutional Layers
MaxPooling Layers
Flatten Layer
Fully Connected Layers
Dropout Layers
Output Layer
